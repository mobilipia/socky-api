# Socky API v0.5

This is draft for protocol of communication between Socky elements. It's open for discussion so please write every proposition under this message - this will be discussed and final version will be posted on github repository.

## Naming:

Socky is created from 3 components: Socky server, Socky JS client library and Socky web-server client library.

- Socky server will wait for connections from clients. Base impementation will be handled [here](http://github.com/socky/socky-server-ruby). From here it will be called "server".
- Socky JS client is used to connect browser to server and receive messages. Base implementation will be handled [here](http://github.com/socky/socky-js). From here it will be called "browser".
- Socky web-server client is used to authenticate browser and send messages to server. Base implementation will be handled [here](http://github.com/socky/socky-client-ruby). From here it will be called "client".

Note that this split to 3 parts is used just to allow demonstrate protocol. Any part can be written in any language and name can be then misleading(i.e. iOS library that will connect and just receive messages will be "browser"). Both "browser" and "client" can be also merged into one part if this connection won't create security risk.

## Additional naming:

- Connection: TCP socket between browser and server
- Application: Namespace of connections. Connections from one application can affect other connections from the same namespace, but no other connections.
  - Application name: Unique name by which application can be identified. Can contain only alphanumeric characters(case sensitive) plus dash and underscore.
- Channel: Group of connections. Every connection can have multiple channels.
  - Public channel: Channel that anybody can join without authentication. This channel type is used at default.
  - Private channel: Channel that need authentication by client. This channel is used if channel name has prefix 'private-'
- User: Group of connections. Every connection can have only one user.

## Starting notes

All data sent over WebSocket protocol should be encoded using JSON.

## Connecting browser to server

If browser want to connect to server then it opens WebSocket connection. Except of server host and port there should be path provided.

Path is created by 2 parts: Socky backend namespace and target application name.

Default Socky backend namespace should be '/websocket', but there should be possibility to change that.

Example:

User want to connect to example.com, port 8080, with default backend namespace and application named 'my_application'. Path will be:

    ws://example.com:8080/websocket/my_application

If application name will not be recognized then server should send following hash and close connection afterwards:

    { 'event' => 'socky:error:unknow_application' }

If server recognize application name then it allows connection and send following hash to browser:

    { 'event' => 'socky:connection_established', 'id' => '<connection_id>' }

Connection_id should be unique identifier of connection. It should contain from 1 to 20 alphanumeric characters encoded as string. Browser should save that id - it will be required to further identifying of connection.

## Connecting to public channel

Any connected browser can subscribe to public channel. In order to do so browser should send to server following hash:

    { 'event' => 'socky:subscribe', 'channels' => 'desired_channel' }

If browser want to subscribe to multiple channels in the same time then name of channel should be changed to array of names:

    { 'event' => 'socky:subscribe', 'channels' => ['channel1', 'channel2'] }

In return to such request server should join browser to channel and return:

    { 'event' => 'socky_internal:subscription_successful', 'channels' => <requested_channels> }

If (for any reason) server will not be able to join browser to channel then it should return:

    { 'event' => 'socky_internal:subscription_unsuccessful', 'channels' => <requested_channels> }
